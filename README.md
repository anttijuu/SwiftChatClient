#  Swift Chat Client

This is a demonstration chat client app build with Swift and SwiftUI.

The client app works with a Java Chat Server app. This server was a topic for the course student project at 2021, in the course Programming 3, at the Study Program of Information Processing Science, University of Oulu, Finland.

Obviously you cannot use this client app without a functioning server to do anything useful. I may publish the Java HTTP chat server app at some point in the future.

The app connects to the server, logs the user in (if already registered) and then you can chat with all the connected clients.

There is also a [console client](https://github.com/anttijuu/O3-chat-client) implemented in Java, having unit tests to test the server students were supposed to implement.
